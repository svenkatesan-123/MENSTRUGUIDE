                    <b>Menstruation is a natural biological function and an indication of reproductive health, but
                        it is still a taboo subject in many nations. In reality, in certain parts of the world,
                        menstruation is still considered humiliating and completely private. Menstrual Hygiene Day,
                        observed on May 28, was established to commemorate the right of people everywhere to manage
                        their menstruation hygienicallyâ€”as well as to raise awareness of the issues that women,
                        girls, and others who menstruate confront around the world.
                        With these hygiene tips, you can have a healthy and pleasant period:-</b>

                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Change the sanitary pad, menstrual cup, or tampon every 4-6 hours:
                </h2>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Did you know that once menstrual blood leaves the body, it can get polluted with germs from
                    the body? The pad will be moist, and microorganisms from sweat will be present. Bacteria
                    have the ability to reproduce, resulting in urinary tract infections, vaginal infections,
                    and skin rashes. Tampons and menstruation cups must be correctly inserted. At least every
                    six hours, replace the tampon and the pad. Don't forget to properly wash your menstruation
                    cup.
                    If the tampon is kept in for an extended period of time, it can cause toxic shock syndrome
                    (TSS), a hazardous medical illness caused by a bacterial infection. Regular pad and tampon
                    changes will prevent discomfort and infection.

                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">2. Keep the vagina clean:
                </h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    It is critical to recognise the importance of keeping the vagina clean, just as it is with any other
                    body part. Are you aware that washing your intimate area from back to front can cause bacteria from
                    the anus to enter the vaginal or urethral opening? This makes you more vulnerable to infections.
                    Clean yourself clean from head to toe. When you are on your period, try to wear fresh cotton
                    underwear.
                </p>


                <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Use of chemical products should be avoided:
                </h2>


                <p class="post-text">
                    The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, as previously stated. Thus, for vaginal hygiene, avoid
                    douching. You will also have to stop using chemical items or soaps down there because they can cause
                    an infection. Overuse of vaginal washes has become fashionable. Further damage to you could result
                    from this.
                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">4. Discard the sanitary napkin or tampons properly:
                </h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    Tampons and sanitary napkins should be disposed away appropriately. Wrap them properly before
                    throwing them away to prevent the spread of bacteria and diseases. Don't flush them because doing so
                    will clog the toilet, cause the water to overflow, and spread bacteria throughout the entire thing.
                    When you have packed and disposed of the used tampons and sanitary napkins, it is crucial to wash
                    your hands thoroughly because you probably touched the soiled area while doing so.


                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">5. Try to avoid a pad rash:
                </h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    A heavy flow can cause a pad rash. This will happen as the pad can be wet for a longer time. Try to
                    change the pad by staying dry and using an ointment, as suggested by an expert after a bath and
                    before bed, this will heal the rash. Pad lining may cause irritation to sensitive skin too. If
                    rashes persist, the skin can be sensitive and indicate high blood sugar or allergy to the product.
                    Please remember that there is apprehension in mothers of young adolescent girls, as these products
                    were not available in their time. So, it is important to counsel both moms and daughters to choose
                    theÂ rightÂ product.
                </p>
