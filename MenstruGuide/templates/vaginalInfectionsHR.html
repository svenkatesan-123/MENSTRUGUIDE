            </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                Candida is a fungus that causes vaginal yeast infections. These yeasts are often found in modest amounts throughout the body. They cause no problem when they are in balance in our body’s ecosystem. However, when the balance gets disrupted, they grow rapidly and cause a yeast infection. This condition is also known as vulvovaginal candidiasis or vaginal candidiasis.

            <p class="post-text">
                <b> Some of the elements that may cause vaginal yeast infections include:</b>

            </p>
            <p class="post-text">
                <li>Tight-fitting clothing </li>
                <li>Use of sanitary pads</li>
                <li>Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs)  </li>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Some remedies</h2>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">1. Diet Modification : </h2>

            <p class="post-text">Consuming yeast-based bread has been linked in studies to recurrent vaginal yeast infections. According to a different study, consumption of refined carbohydrates may contribute to the worsening of vaginal yeast infection symptoms. Vaginal yeast infections may be treated with a diet low in yeast and processed sugars. To back up these findings, more study is necessary.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">2. Garlic </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                Perhaps garlic has antifungal properties. Garlic may be able to treat vaginal yeast infections, according to studies. Allicin, the active ingredient in garlic, may inhibit the growth of fungi. To demonstrate its efficacy, more studies on humans and animals are needed. Moreover, it could result in chemical burns or allergic responses. Hence before using, please seek medical advice.

            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">3. Tea tree oil </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                According to several research, tea tree oil may have the ability to function as a natural antifungal and antibacterial agent. It might be beneficial to use tea tree pessaries, a medication capsule placed into the vagina, or tea tree oil in the bath. They might also be offered as creams and gels. There is a potential that it will irritate certain people extremely badly. In a study, it was hypothesised that the vagina's acidic environment would affect tea tree oil's ability to work. Because of this, each individual may experience different affects on the vagina.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">4. Probiotics  </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                Good bacteria (probiotics) might help against vaginal yeast infections. The recolonisation (refilling the lost bacteria) of bacteria, especially lactobacillus, might be helpful. Therefore, your doctor might recommend eating yoghurt, probiotic capsules, etc. Sometimes, your doctor might prescribe you probiotic creams that have to be applied to the vagina or inserted into it.

            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">5. Creams and Pessaries 
            </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                According to several research, tea tree oil may have the ability to function as a natural antifungal and antibacterial agent. It might be beneficial to use tea tree pessaries, a medication capsule placed into the vagina, or tea tree oil in the bath. They might also be offered as creams and gels.

Because of this, each individual may experience different affects on the vagina.

            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">6. Clothing </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                Sweating may result from wearing tight-fitting clothing, pantyhose, or synthetic undergarments. In order to avoid any fungal infections, it is best to avoid them. To treat fungus infections, cotton undergarments and clothing are preferable. This is not supported by science, though. According to one study, sterilising newly washed and dried underwear in the microwave may help lower the risk of vaginal yeast infection.
                Tea made from nettles: Tea made from nettles is a natural source of iron and vitamin C. Nettle tea may be used to treat anaemia.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">7. Coriander seeds  
            </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                According to India's official health portal, coriander seeds may be effective in treating vaginal yeast infections. You must soak some coriander seeds in water overnight before using them. It might be beneficial to strain the water and consume it on an empty stomach. But, before using this cure, you should speak with a doctor.

            </p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">8. Cranberry Juice    
            </h2>

            <p class="post-text">
                Cranberry juice consumption may also prove beneficial for treating vaginal yeast infections. Perhaps even better is to have fresh cranberry juice devoid of added sugars. To demonstrate the potential benefits of cranberry juice against vaginal infection, more research is needed.
